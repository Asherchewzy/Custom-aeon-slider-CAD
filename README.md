## Commercial alternative
A commercial solution is available. However, for some regions custom 3DP may be a cheaper alternative. One may also wish to print a single side only. The contact area for a soul based grind is about 56.7% lesser when compared to a commercial solution, which in theory means less friction and a faster grind. However, this is in theory and the project makes no guarentee of being better than any commercial solutions out there. The mounting points (counter-bore hole) are also slightly different to make it easier as some may experience difficulty mounting the back tee nut. 

For me, this is a passion project. I decided to challenge myself by learning a whole new skillset and a few softwares.

## Material Recommendation
It is recommended that this model be printed in **Nylon (MJF/SLS PA-12)** for optimal performance and durability. If you have access to UHMW plastic, that would be even better.
